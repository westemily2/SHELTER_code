# SHELTER_code

The code presents an agent-based model for Ravenna, Italy, created by Ekodenge UK as part of the SHELTER project, task 2.6.

The model simulates a 2-month period of climatic data in Ravenna, including both rainfall and temperature. Based on this, there is a map of the city 
divided into cells which can flood if too much rainfall occurs. Whether a cell floods or not is based on both its surface type and subsequent 
permeability, as well as the percent of the cell which is greened. When the model is launched, the user has options to change the amount of greening
present in each cell to varying amounts, determined by the amount of 'greenable' cover of the cell. Three types of land have been modelled as greenable,
these are pedestrian areas, streets and car parks. 

The model can be launched by typing into the command prompt 'mesa runserver'.
